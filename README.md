# Game_2048
My own take on the classic 2048 puzzle game! I built this from scratch using Python and Pygame. Unlike simple text-based versions, this project features a full graphical interface, smooth tile sliding animations, and "pop-up" effects. You can play using the keyboard (WASD/Arrows) or by swiping with the mouse, just like on a smartphone.
